# Why Your SMB Needs Custom Software (Not a Template)

Every week I get the same question: *"Why should I pay for custom software when there are free templates?"*

The short answer: **because templates don't solve YOUR specific problem**.

## The problem with generic solutions

Templates and generic solutions are designed for the "average." The problem is that your business isn't average. It has unique processes, specific workflows, and particular needs that no template can anticipate.

### Real example: The distributor case

A client came with a "solution" they had purchased: a generic ERP system at $500/month. The problem:

- **Didn't adapt to their inventory flow** (they handled perishable products with complex FIFO logic)
- **Required 3 hours daily of manual work** to "adapt" the data
- **Provider took weeks** to respond to customization requests
- **Paid for features they never used** (80% of the system was unnecessary)

### The custom solution

We designed a specific system for their operation:

- **Automatic FIFO logic** that considered expiration dates
- **Direct integration with their suppliers** via API
- **Personalized alerts** based on their real metrics
- **One-time development cost** + $50/month hosting

**Result:** From 20 hours weekly of manual work to 2 hours. ROI in 4 months.

## When you need custom software

Not all businesses need custom development. But if you recognize any of these symptoms, it's time to consider a custom solution:

### 1. You're "adapting" your business to the tool

If you change your processes to fit the software (instead of the other way around), you're using the wrong tool.

### 2. You spend hours on manual work "because the system doesn't do it"

Exporting Excel, copying data, sending emails manually... all this should be automated.

### 3. You pay for features you don't use

Using 20% of your current software? You're subsidizing development you don't need.

### 4. The provider takes weeks to implement changes

Your business evolves fast. Your software should be able to do so too.

## The method: Software as a scientific experiment

My approach isn't to "sell you" software. It's to **solve your specific problem**:

1. **Deep diagnosis:** 2-3 sessions to understand your real operation (not what you think you need)
2. **Rapid prototype:** Functional MVP in 1-2 weeks to validate the solution
3. **Data-driven iteration:** Continuous adjustments based on real usage metrics
4. **Progressive scaling:** Add features only when you need them

## Cases where you SHOULD use templates

I'm honest: you don't always need custom development. Use templates/SaaS if:

- **You're starting** and need to validate your business model
- **The process is standard** (e.g., sending newsletters, scheduling meetings)
- **The cost of "adapting" is low** (adjusting your flow doesn't affect your operation)
- **The provider is responsive** and adds the features you need

## Conclusion: Software is a tool, not an end

The goal isn't to "have pretty software." It's to **optimize your operation to scale**.

If your current software makes you slower (instead of faster), something is wrong.
